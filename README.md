## message_count.py
This program will return the number of messages in your top chats so you can see which people you text the most which groupchats are the most active. 

Make sure to follow instructions at the top of the file to ensure the script runs correctly. There are errors in the fbchat module that need to be changed to ensure the code runs smoothly. 

## schedule_send.py
This program will allow you to schedule a message to send at a later time (a feature available in Gmail and Slack, but not Messenger). Simply input the name of the person/group chat you would like to message (or choose a number from the shown list) and type in your message and delivery time. Ensure that the code runs in the backgrouns and is not terminated, or else the message will not send.
